## What is MultiDevin?

MultiDevin is a version of Devin that constitutes 1 “manager” Devin and up to 10 “worker” Devins. The manager Devin creates the worker Devins, distributes a task to each worker Devin, then merges the changes from all *successful* worker Devins into one branch or pull request. 

### Reasons to use MultiDevin

- 🏎️ **Speed:** Worker Devins run in parallel.
- 💪 **Reliability:** Each Devin is given a much smaller task to work on, so is much more likely to complete it successfully.
- 💚 **Ease-of-use:** Manager Devin only incorporates successful worker runs into the final PR (+ you can define what “success” means!). Even if one or two workers fail, you still get a mergeable PR out of it.
- 🧹 **Cleanliness:** MultiDevin creates one PR with several small fixes rather than one PR per fix. This becomes much easier to maintain and merge.

### When to use MultiDevin

MultiDevin is very good at getting through large backlogs of smaller tasks. Use MultiDevin when:

- 🥷 Each task can be performed in isolation.
- ⏳ Tasks can be performed incrementally, i.e. a regular ‘drip’ of PRs that each solve a small portion of the overall backlog.
- 🟢 Devin has a high likelihood of solving the task without extensive prompting (e.g. lint errors, code smells, etc.)
- 👍 Success can be easily defined (i.e. a warning no longer shows up/build passes).

## MultiDevin fields

```
Title
// Solely for your own reference

Respository name
// The repository that all tasks take place in. There can only be a single
// `repository` per MultiDevin batch.

Snapshot
// The snapshot that will be used by manager and worker Devins.

Playbook
// The playbook that will be used by worker Devins. This will automatically 
// update.

Worker prompt
// The prompt that is passed to every worker Devin. Include information on 
// tackling the task (e.g. how to build the project, how to run lint)
// Include your worker's success criteria (e.g. resolved error, build passing).

Merge workers into a single PR?
// If selected, manager Devin will only merge the successful worker Devins.
// If not selected, manager Devin will simply spawn worker Devins then exit.

=============================== Advanced Settings ===============================

Worker timeout
// The amount of time (in minutes) each worker Devin has before automatic timeout
// failure. 
// Defaults to 30 minutes.

Manager 
// The prompt that is passed to the manager Devin. This is typically used
// for custom PR creation behavior, git behavior, merge behavior, or to ask for an
// "overall" check/test prior to PR creation.
// Defaults to "Once you have successfully merged all the fixes into your branch, 
// you should create a PR and share the PR link with me."

Root branch
// The name of the branch that the PR is created into.
```
