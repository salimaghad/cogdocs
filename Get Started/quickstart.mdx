> ⭐ Refer to the following [step-by-step GitHub Integration Guide](https://www.notion.so/GitHub-Integration-Guide-f839572ed60a4d41ae2620c08c2fdb62?pvs=21) for more information.
> 
1. Go to [Settings > Integrations](https://preview.devin.ai/settings/integrations) to begin setting up the GitHub integration and click on Connect

2. Select the repo(s) you’d like to integrate, which you can do from the **Settings** page. 

Ensure you are integrating the right GitHub organization with the right Devin account (e.g. if you are connecting your personal repo, your account should say your name at the top left of your screen).

3. If you cannot yet integrate your organization’s GitHub, integrate a personal GitHub account.

## Set up your Repo

1. Start any Devin session to install your repo

2. Go to the menu on the top right hand corner of Devin’s Workspace and select **Use Devin’s Machine**.

3. This will open an interactive file editor, complete with a shell. Perform all necessary installation steps in this screen on Devin’s behalf.

## Create a Machine Snapshot
    
    1. Once the installation is complete, go back to the Devin session where you installed the repo  and click the “**Create machine snapshot**” button in the bottom right corner.
        
        A [snapshot](https://www.notion.so/Machine-Snapshots-Guide-c987b1c5425642518f583b79acb44954?pvs=21)  allows you to initialize new Devin instances from the snapshotted machine image. This will let you skip the installation steps going forward.

    2. Fill out the required information on the Snapshot Creation form. Please note that:
        1. The snapshot will be shared with all other members of your org. Choose a descriptive name.
        2. The snapshot description will be used by Devin to understand the contents of the machine image. Devin ‘forgets’ all of context from the original run. As a result, you should mention anything that would be helpful/necessary for future Devins to know!
        3. `Startup commands` will execute sequentially and automatically when starting from a snapshot.
    3. [Optional] Consider setting it as your default snapshot. All subsequent runs will automatically start from this snapshot, including runs started on Slack.
    4. You can now find all your machine snapshots in the top right section before starting a session. Remember to select the machine snapshot you want to use ***before*** starting a new session.
