title: "Introducing Devin"
description: "Welcome to Devin!"
---

Devin is an autonomous AI software engineer that can write, run and test code, helping software engineers work on personal tasks or their team projects. Devin has helped build websites, web applications, review and fix bugs, support code migrations and even day-to-day assistant tasks like ordering on Amazon or DoorDash!

Here are just some of the use cases the Cognition team and Devin's early users have used Devin for:

- Building small applications
- Building data visualization tools & dashboards
- Scraping
- Refactoring and up-leveling code quality
- Updating libraries  or dependencies
- Code navigation
- Unit & integration tests

## Getting Access

If your company is already working with Cognition, you can request permissions with your Administrator or Cognition directly and access Devin via the web application preview.devin.ai.

If you do not have access and your name is already on our waitlist, we do small waitlist releases every week and invite users to join our Technical Preview along with our Slack and Discord communities.

## General Product Features

### The Devin Interface

Devin is designed to be a conversational user interface, and allows you to follow Devin’s development and planning process in the **Workspace** section.

In Devin’s Workspace, you’ll find: 

- **Shell** (or command-line interface): a text-based interface where Devin can input commands that interact directly with a computer's operating system.
- **Browser**: where Devin navigates during a session to search for  information. You can watch Devin browsing through documentation, navigate through websites, download/upload upload information, and jump in to help Devin navigate thorough browsing tasks.
- **Editor**: this is where Devin will write code. Here you can supervise, review and edit (see our [VSCode Guide](https://www.notion.so/bd89720db24e4f52bcd63489ff87e3fa?pvs=21)) the code Devin is writing.
- **Planner**: This section provides you a running "to do" list that Devin laid out to complete the task. This gives you  visibility into how Devin plans and thinks through solving a problem.

## Limitations

Devin is an early product and has lots to learn. The Cognition team is working hard to improve Devin’s breadth of capabilities. 

As you use Devin, keep in mind tasks that will be harder for it to execute successfully:

- **Large-scale challenges:** Devin generally performs better on smaller-scoped tasks and single file rather than multi-file edits. For more complex edits, we highly suggest using **playbooks** or breaking up the project into smaller, isolated tasks that you can run in separate sessions that build on each other.
- **Consistency and reliability:** Devin will sometimes get off-track. Sometimes you’ll be able to nudge Devin back on track, other times you may want to restart the run.
- **UI-related aesthetics:** Devin can build functional frontends, but will need your help with aesthetics.
- **Security:** This is top priority at Cognition, but we ask all users to exercise caution when sharing credentials with Devin or granting access to specific platforms. Any time you are sharing credentials with Devin, make sure you use the Secrets Manager or via the secure credential-sharing channel provided by Devin in the chat if the credentials aren't already available in the Secrets Manager.

## Feedback

We’re learning and our customers’ input is crucial! If you are part of the Technical Preview, please reach out via our Slack Community. For all other customers and partners you can share your feedback to support@cognition.ai or directly in the web app.

We log all feedback provided by customers and use it to make quick improvements to Devin, inform our product priorities and roadmap.
