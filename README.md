# Introducing Devin

Devin is an autonomous AI software engineer that can write code, helping software engineering teams on tasks like creating websites, web applications, reviewing and fixing bugs, migrations and more…

Here are just some of the use cases the Cognition team and beta users have used Devin for:

- Building small applications
- Building data visualization tools & dashboards
- Scraping
- Refactoring and up-leveling code quality
- Updating libraries  or dependencies
- Code navigation
- Unit & integration tests
- Many day-to-day assistant tasks like ordering on Amazon, DoorDash, and more

## Getting Access

If your company is already working with Cognition, you can request permissions with your Administrator or Cognition directly and access Devin via the web application preview.devin.ai.

If you do not have access and your name is already on our waitlist, we do small waitlist releases every week and invite users to join our Technical Preview along with our Slack/Discord community.

## General Product Features

### The Devin Interface

Devin is designed to be a conversational user interface, and allows you to follow Devin’s development and planning process in the **Workspace** section.

In Devin’s Workspace, you’ll find: 

- **Shell** (or command-line interface): a text-based interface where Devin can input commands that interact directly with a computer's operating system.
- **Browser**: where Devin navigates during a session to search for  information. You can watch Devin browsing through documentation, navigate through websites, download/upload upload information, and jump in to help Devin navigate thorough browsing tasks.
- **Editor**: this is where Devin will write code. Here you can supervise, review and edit (see our [VSCode Guide](https://www.notion.so/bd89720db24e4f52bcd63489ff87e3fa?pvs=21)) the code Devin is writing.
- **Planner**: This section provides you a running "to do" list that Devin laid out to complete the task. This gives you  visibility into how Devin plans and thinks through solving a problem.

### Product Features

There are several feature highlights that make working with Devin super easy!

- **Playbooks**: A playbook is like a custom system prompt. It’s also like writing a program, without the rigid syntax. Playbooks allow you to be prescriptive and detailed when giving Devin instructions.
- **Machine Snapshots**: Machine snapshots are ‘save’ states for Devin. After you take a snapshot, you can start from that machine state on any future Devin run.
- **VSCode:** Read and edit files on Devin’s machine just like if you were working with Devin in VSCode, or open up a terminal to get full access to Devin’s machine.

We also have integrations with Slack and Github, and plan to have many more with your preferred dev tools. You can find more information on all these features and integrations in our [Product Guides](https://www.notion.so/Product-Guides-4a47d7181e1d4533b996b8d574c13b23?pvs=21) section.

## Limitations

Devin is an early product and has lots to learn. The Cognition team is working hard to improve Devin’s breadth of capabilities. 

As you use Devin, keep in mind tasks that will be harder for it to execute successfully:

- **Large-scale challenges:** Devin generally performs better on smaller-scoped tasks and single file rather than multi-file edits.
    - For more complex edits, we highly suggest using **playbooks**.
- **Consistency and reliability:** Devin will sometimes get off-track. Sometimes you’ll be able to nudge Devin back on track, other times you may want to restart the run.
- **UI-related aesthetics:** Devin can build functional frontends, but will need your help with aesthetics.
- **Security:** This is top priority at Cognition, but we ask all users to exercise caution when sharing credentials with Devin or granting access to specific platforms.
