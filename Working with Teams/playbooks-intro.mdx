## What are Playbooks?

### Playbooks easily shareable, reusable prompts

A playbook is like a custom system prompt. It’s also like writing a program, without the rigid syntax. 

Playbooks are also easily shareable and reusable, so once anyone succeeds with Devin, others can more easily replicate that success!

As an example of what playbooks enable, you can:

- send Devin a message describing a feature to build
- share with Devin the relevant playbook (e.g. `quick_pr.devin.md`)

And Devin will now more reliably **follow best practices for contributing to your company’s repository** —  e.g. remembering what to include in the PR description, reading PR review comments from coworkers, and sharing the PR link every time new changes are made.

### Playbooks can immediately unlock Devin’s ability to contribute in a wide range of areas, but require some upfront investment to write

In the future Devin will create and maintain playbooks all by itself, learning from its past work and its observations of your company’s codebase over time. 

We recommend using Playbooks when:

- You or your teammates will reuse the prompt or instructions on multiple sessions.
- The use case may be relevant to others — in your organization or within the Devin user community.

## Getting Started with Playbooks

Consider writing your first playbook with a simple multi-step task you want Devin to tackle.

1. Create a document that outlines (1) the outcome you want Devin to achieve, and (2) the steps required to get there. 
2. **Optional:** Add a **Procedure** section.
    1. The Procedure should span the  entire scope of the task.
    2. Include at least one step for setup, the actual task, and delivery.
    3. Aim to make the steps **Mutually Exclusive** and **Collectively Exhaustive**
3. **Optional**: Add sections like **Specification**, **Advice**, **Forbidden Actions,** etc.
    1. **Specification**: Describe postconditions - what should be true after Devin is done?
    2. **Advice**: Include tips to correct Devin’s priors.
4. **Optional**: Add a section describing what’s required from the user.
5. Save the file with the file extension `.devin.md` and drag-and-drop it in the web app when starting a Devin Session.
    1. Alternatively, you can create the playbook directly in the web app by clicking “Create a new Playbook”

### **Tips**

- Pick a task that you’re an expert in so that you can give good advice.
- You’ve successfully attached a playbook to a sessions if you see an blue pill appear, along with an inline component for editing the playbook before starting your session

- You may need to iterate on the playbook a few times to cover all the mistakes Devin tends to make.
- Devin can follow both high level instructions (e.g. “first set up a new conda environment”)  and explicit low level instructions (e.g. “To create a PR from the command line, use this command: echo -e "..." > `PR_DESCRIPTION.md` && gh pr create --body-file=`PR_DESCRIPTION.md`”)
