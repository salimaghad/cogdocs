## How to use Playbooks

To use playbooks simply select one from your Team or the Community library. You’ve successfully attached a playbook if you see a a blue pill appear, along with an inline component for editing the playbook before starting your session

Alternatively, you can attach a `<filename>.devin.md` file when you start your Devin session…

Once you start the session, you should see your playbook show up with a grey background in the chat with Devin!

## Refining Playbooks

As you run a new playbook with Devin, you’ll identify opportunities to improve the instructions so that Devin can complete the task and more reliably. Here are some helpful features to **iterate on playbooks live**:

### Rollback: Restore live sessions to a previous point in the run

Rewind Devin’s memory and file system to any past moment in time and resume - useful for undoing wrong decisions, exploring alternative solutions, quickly iterating on playbooks/prompts, and more.

Simply scrub through the session timeline on the righthand side and restore the checkpoint of the session you would like to go back to.

### Edit playbook steps and then rollback

You can now edit playbooks while you’re running a session! If Devin isn’t responding to the playbook instructions as desired, you can rollback to a previous state in the session, edit the step in the playbook you want to make clearer for Devin, and retry the individual step.

This will allow you to test and iterate to make the playbook more reliable, much faster!
