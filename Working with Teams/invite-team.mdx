Add members to your Devin organization so you can collaborate with your team and create sessions within the same org. 

`Members` can start Devin sessions and view and contribute to your organization’s knowledge, playbooks, machine snapshots and more. `Admins` can invite other team members and set up organization integrations.

Want to share your Devin sessions with people outside your team? Share a link to your sessions so a person outside of your organization can view Devin’s work. Make sure you don’t share anything confidential!
