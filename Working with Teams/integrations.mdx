## Slack 

Once you’ve connected Slack to your organization, you’ll be able to initialize Devin via Slack just by tagging **@Devin**. Devin responds in-thread with updates and questions, just as in the regular chat interface. 


### Slack Organization Integration

1. In the **Integrations** tab on your [Settings](https://preview.devin.ai/settings/integrations) page, click the “Connect” button to integrate your organization with the Devin Slack app.  You have to be a Slack Admin to set up this integration.

2. Once you’ve completed the flow, ensure that your status has updated to look like this.

### Slack User Integration

Individual users can set up their Slack “Connected User”  at https://preview.devin.ai/settings/integrations

This is not required, but once set up:

1. Users will be able to use the “send to channel” feature, which mirrors sessions started via the web app on Slack. This enables anyone in the channel (with Devin access) to quickly follow along and collaborate with Devin.
    1. both Devin and the user need to be added to the same Slack channels for this feature to show up!

2.  Devin sessions started via Slack will show up with the proper Creator name, rather than “Slack User”.

Once your integration is complete, your interface should look like this:

> Note: If your user account is not properly connecting, ensure that your Slack email is the same as your email in https://preview.devin.ai/settings. If not, please authenticate the correct email on Slack.

### How to use Devin from Slack

Once you’ve installed the Devin Slack integration, simply trigger Devin with @Devin in any channel. You may include attachments to your message.

Devin will respond in-thread to your session. Now, you can communicate back and forth as you would in the regular chat interface.

![Screenshot 2024-04-22 at 4.28.01 PM.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/4f925d22-65a4-47c3-9aed-b65e115aaef3/298c4822-16aa-4dff-ae58-02e6b84dd6b7/Screenshot_2024-04-22_at_4.28.01_PM.png)

As usual, sessions without any response for 24 hours will automatically expire.

### Inline Slack Keywords & Functions

`mute` → prevents Devin from sending further Slack messages.

`unmute` → reverses the above.

`(aside)` → causes Devin to ignore the message (useful for commenting on Devin’s run directly in-thread)

`EXIT` → ends the session.

`snapshot:<snapshot name>` → Use a particular snapshot with your run

`playbook:<playbook-name>` → Use a particular playbook with your run

### Turn on Slack Notifications

You can enable Slack notifications for specific runs and Devin will privately message you whenever there’s a status update. To do so, simply click the Slack icon at the top of any run you’d like to be notified for.

### Dedicated Devin channel

We recommend setting up an specific channel (e.g. **#devin-runs**) to keep all of your Devin requests in one location.
