### **Start with a specific task you’re familiar with**

To start, don't worry about making something general or reusable; **focus on getting Devin to do 1 specific task reliably.**

### **Write ## Procedure**

- The Procedure should have **one step per line**, each line written imperatively.
- The Procedure should span the entire scope of the task.
- Include at least one step for setup, the actual task, and delivery.
- Aim to make the steps **Mutually Exclusive** and **Collectively Exhaustive**
- **Additional Tips**
    - The Procedure section should help you define order of actions Devin should take - like if/else/loops/goto in code
    - **Don’t make (sub-)tasks too specific unless you really need to;** this can reduce Devin’s ability to problem-solve
    - Each procedure step should contain an action verb - e.g. Write, Navigate to, etc.

### Write **## Advice and Pointers**

- You have a preferred way of completing the tasks.
- Advice applies more globally. Otherwise, if the advice only applies to one Procedure step, write the advice under the procedure step - use nested bullet points.
- You are correcting Devin’s priors. These can function like comments on the pseudocode (**Procedure)** that influence its execution.

### Write **## Specification**

The **Specifications** section can be helpful to describe the postconditions of the playbook — what should be true once Devin is done?

### Write **## What’s Needed From User**

Think through if anything is necessary but outside of Devin’s control. For example, if the user needs to provide a token to Devin.

### **Other Tips + Tactics**

- **Iterate and improve through trial and error**
    - Running 2+ Devins in parallel with the same playbook to quickly identify possible errors.
    - If Devin needs help, chat with it to help it along. Then add to your playbook so Devin succeeds without intervention next time.
- **Tell Devin what good looks like**
    - Be explicit about what the deliverable is & how Devin should communicate the fact that it’s done (e.g. what files to attach or links to share, if any)
- **Optimize how quickly your playbook takes to run**
    - Explore the different decisions Devin can make, and guide Devin down the most efficient path in the playbook.
- **Specific commands, incantations and strings are fair game**
    - They can be the difference maker between a working playbook and a broken one.
    - For example, the following can be a very good detail to include because alloy and tts-1 are probably not things Devin would've picked otherwise, and this guides Devin in a direction that is more likely to succeed!
    
    ```
    3. Create request dict with model: "tts-1", voice: "alloy", text: <passed text from user>
    ```
