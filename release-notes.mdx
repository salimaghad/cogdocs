<Accordion title="Universal Planner">
  With Universal Planner, Devin can now more reliably perform long, multi-step tasks that require **looping** — in other words, tasks that require performing the same action multiple times — without needing to use Playbooks. 

<Frame>
    ![Devin](/images/rn_playbooks1.png)
</Frame>

Playbooks are still recommended for tasks and prompts that will be run multiple times or prompts that are helpful to share with your team. 
</Accordion>


<Accordion title="Devin got smarter!">

Many of our improvements this week have been behind the scenes **improvements to Devin’s instruction following, editing, planning, and speed:**

📚 Playbooks **no longer expect or require a rigid structure** (e.g. ## Procedure section is no longer needed)
💬 Devin is a better **communicator!** When DevinAI makes notable deviations from the initial plan, it will inform you more reliably.
🔢 Devin is less reliant on playbooks and can follow ad-hoc plans more effectively

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Add secrets to library mid-session">

Convenience improvement for secrets management:

#### <Icon icon="books" iconType="solid" /> Playbooks Library

You can now easily create, view and use playbooks by going to the **Devin app > Library > Playbooks.** You’ll be able to create playbooks for your personal use cases, and explore playbooks from the community. Any playbooks you create will be shared with your team.

#### <Icon icon="camera" iconType="solid" /> Machine Snapshot Startup Commands

For a given machine snapshot, you can now **set a list of startup commands that will be run at the beginning of every run**. Some details:

- The commands are run from `~`
- The commands run in sequence (so having `cd dir` and then `ls` will do `ls` from `dir`)
- Each command is given a 2 minute timeout (so you can't run long-running servers with these commands)

<Frame>

With command history, you can easily see a list of all the commands that Devin ran, along with a preview of their outputs. 

💡 **Tip**:
- Click on a command to jump to the timestamp where Devin used the command.

#### <Icon icon="sun-bright" iconType="solid" /> Keep Alive

Keep Alive will keep a session alive indefinitely, and will count against Technical Preview users’ daily quota.  Manually terminating a session will override Keep Alive.

Note that Keep Alive is useful for keeping any hosted services (devinapps.com links) alive, but is **not necessary** if Devin helps you deploy apps using third party services like Netlify, Firebase, Vercel, etc.

#### <Icon icon="computer" iconType="solid" /> Open VS Code: Access Devin’s machine

Open VS Code lets you read and edit files on Devin’s machine just like if you were working with Devin in VSCode. You can also open up a terminal in Devin’s machine, which means you have **full access** to Devin’s machine.

💡 **Tip**:
Combine VSCode with our [Machine Snapshots feature](/Onboard_Devin/snapshots) to set up everything Devin needs to be productive moving forward:
- Tell Devin **“Run `pwd` and then pause. Do not do anything else.”**
- **Open VSCode and open up a terminal** once Devin is paused
- **Do any machine setup yourself** (install packages, configure repos, etc.)
- **Create a snapshot.** Moving forward start sessions with this snapshot - all your future Devins will benefit from the setup you prepared!

#### <Icon icon="cookies" iconType="solid" /> Cookies + Persisted Secrets

With Persisted Secrets, any secrets that you add in the Settings page will be usable by Devin in all future Devin sessions.

Additionally, with site cookies, Devin will find that it's already logged in to sites you provide valid cookies for (no login required by Devin!). 

- Note that **this is a beta feature** and may not work for some sites, but we’ve found that it works for Amazon and Resy, and are excited to explore together what else this enables!
- Additionally, Devin may still ask for credentials. You’ll need to remind Devin to first check using its browser whether it’s already logged in!

#### <Icon icon="lock" iconType="solid" /> [Organizations] Unlist Sessions

> This feature is only available to Organizations, not Technical Preview or Personal accounts
> 

My default, all new sessions are visible to your Team (aka Organization). To make a session private to you, click the menu icon (which appears on hover) next to your session name in the sidebar to find the Unlist session option.

#### <Icon icon="slack" iconType="solid" />  [Organizations] Slack Integration

> This feature is only available to Organizations, not Technical Preview or Personal accounts
> 

Once you’ve connected Slack to your organization, you’ll be able to initialize Devin directly just by tagging @Devin in Slack. Devin responds in-thread with updates and questions, just as in the regular chat interface. 

You can also enable Slack notifications for specific runs and Devin will privately message you whenever there’s a status update. To do so, simply click the Slack icon at the top of any run you’d like to be notified for.


💡 **Tip**: Use these inline Slack commands to manage your Devin session:
- “mute” → prevents Devin from sending further Slack messages.
- “unmute” → reverses the above.
- “(aside)” → causes Devin to ignore the message (useful for commenting on Devin’s run in-thread).
- “EXIT” → ends the session.
- snapshot:[snapshot-name] → Use a particular snapshot with your run
- playbook:[playbook-name] → Use a particular playbook with your run
