### 📸 Machine Snapshot Startup Commands

For a given machine snapshot, you can now **set a list of startup commands that will be run at the beginning of every run**. Some details:

- The commands are run from `~`
- The commands run in sequence (so having `cd dir` and then `ls` will do `ls` from `dir`)
- Each command is given a 2 minute timeout (so you can't run long-running servers with these commands)

### 🗒️ Command History

![Screenshot 2024-05-13 at 1.56.17 PM.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/4f925d22-65a4-47c3-9aed-b65e115aaef3/8bbda795-5648-4eaa-a9da-0c8bc79dc7c6/Screenshot_2024-05-13_at_1.56.17_PM.png)

With command history, you can easily see a list of all the commands that Devin ran, along with a preview of their outputs. 

💡 **Tips**:

- Click on a command to jump to the timestamp where Devin used the command.
- Click the menu icon (appears when you hover over a command) to copy the full output.

### 🔆 Keep Alive

Keep Alive will keep a session alive indefinitely, and will count against Technical Preview users’ daily quota.  Manually terminating a session will override Keep Alive.

Note that Keep Alive is useful for keeping any hosted services (devinapps.com links) alive, but is **not necessary** if Devin helps you deploy apps using third party services like Netlify, Firebase, Vercel, etc.

### 🚨 Browser Notifications

![Screenshot 2024-05-13 at 8.28.09 PM.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/4f925d22-65a4-47c3-9aed-b65e115aaef3/743d6aec-be3b-404c-b255-4a43b22d489f/Screenshot_2024-05-13_at_8.28.09_PM.png)

Get notified when Devin sends you a message. You can find this under Settings > Profile.

### ⏸️  Pause Devin

![Screenshot 2024-05-13 at 1.47.29 PM.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/4f925d22-65a4-47c3-9aed-b65e115aaef3/63e53c11-e23a-4e18-8a0a-9f7c77da826e/Screenshot_2024-05-13_at_1.47.29_PM.png)

The new pause button is a shortcut and alternative to telling Devin to pause.

### 👩‍💻 Open VS Code: Get full access to Devin’s machine

![Screenshot 2024-05-13 at 1.48.55 PM.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/4f925d22-65a4-47c3-9aed-b65e115aaef3/e0fe1437-be3a-40d9-8e27-5de131dca1c6/Screenshot_2024-05-13_at_1.48.55_PM.png)

Open VS Code lets you read and edit files on Devin’s machine just like if you were working with Devin in VSCode. You can also open up a terminal in Devin’s machine, which means you have **full access** to Devin’s machine.

💡 **Tip:** Combine VSCode with our [Machine Snapshots feature](https://www.notion.so/Guide-to-Machine-Snapshots-8778fd6e1d2f452c8ad4ae98a2c18cb8?pvs=21) to set up everything Devin needs to be productive moving forward. One potential approach:

- Tell Devin **“Run `pwd` and then pause. Do not do anything else.”**
- **Open VSCode and open up a terminal** once Devin is paused
- **Do any machine setup yourself** (install packages, configure repos, etc.)
- **Create a snapshot.** Moving forward start sessions with this snapshot - all your future Devins will benefit from the setup you prepared!

### 🔑 Cookies + Persisted Secrets

With Persisted Secrets, any secrets that you add in the Settings page will be usable by Devin in all future Devin sessions.

Additionally, with site cookies, Devin will find that it's already logged in to sites you provide valid cookies for (no login required by Devin!). 

- Note that **this is a beta feature** and may not work for some sites, but we’ve found that it works for Amazon and Resy, and are excited to explore together what else this enables!
- Additionally, Devin may still ask for credentials. You’ll need to remind Devin to first check using its browser whether it’s already logged in!

### 🔒 [Organization Accounts] Unlist Sessions

> This feature is only available to Organizations, not Technical Preview or Personal accounts
> 

My default, all new sessions are visible to your Team (aka Organization). To make a session private to you, click the menu icon (which appears on hover) next to your session name in the sidebar to find the Unlist session option.

### 💬 [Organization Accounts] Slack Integration

> This feature is only available to Organizations, not Technical Preview or Personal accounts
> 

Once you’ve connected Slack to your organization, you’ll be able to initialize Devin directly just by tagging @Devin in Slack. Devin responds in-thread with updates and questions, just as in the regular chat interface. 

You can also enable Slack notifications for specific runs and Devin will privately message you whenever there’s a status update. To do so, simply click the Slack icon at the top of any run you’d like to be notified for.

**💡 Tips: Inline Slack keyboards**

- “mute” → prevents Devin from sending further Slack messages.
- “unmute” → reverses the above.
- “(aside)” → causes Devin to ignore the message (useful for commenting on Devin’s run in-thread).
- “EXIT” → ends the session.
- snapshot:”<snapshot name>” → Use a particular snapshot with your run
- playbook:<playbook-name> → Use a particular playbook with your run
