You can now easily track and review what Devinâ€™s accomplished with the Work Log in the Planner tab! In Devinâ€™s workspace, go to the Planner and click each step to read Devinâ€™s retro of its work.

Devin will list all the planner steps taken so far, provide a description of the actions taken, and provide a ðŸŸ¢/ ðŸŸ Â / ðŸ”´ grade for each step (corresponding to A/B/C grades). Youâ€™ll also find timestamps and how long Devin spent on each step.

### Use the Work Log to:

- Get more information on Devinâ€™s actions.
- Debug and understand which parts of the task went wrong. Helpful for iterating on longer-scoped tasks and/or playbooks!
- Understand where Devin is spending the majority of its time. Helpful when optimizing tasks that Devin will repeat.
