## How to access Devin’s Machine

After you kick off a run and Devin initializes its machine, click the three dots on the upper right corner and select **Use Devin’s Machine**.

</Frame>

Once selected, you’ll launch a new VSCode session. Click on “**Yes, I trust the authors**” and then you can view Devin’s code:

</Frame>

## Terminal

You can also use VSCode to open up a terminal! To do this simply use the shortcut `Ctrl-``  or, on a Mac, use the shortcut `Cmd-j`. This will open up a terminal where you can now run any commands you like or test Devin’s code.

## Tips

<Accordion title="Edit while the session is running">
You can only use and interact with Devin’s machine while the sessions is running. Once the session is terminated it’s no longer available.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Check out file diffs">
You can view current and a log of Devin’s edits under three dots menu > **View Global File Diff.** This section will show all files modified by Devin, with the temporary exception of some edits made via the shell.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Keep Devin a heads up when making edits">
If you do edit files or otherwise make changes to Devin’s machine state, make sure to tell Devin what you changed! Otherwise Devin might get confused — imagine if your code mysteriously changed while you were in the middle of working on it.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Help Devin on the last mile">
If Devin got you 90% of the way there, you can jump into its machine and make the final changes to complete the task before opening a PR.
</Accordion>
