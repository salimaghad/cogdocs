## How to access Devin’s Machine

After you kick off a run and Devin initializes its machine, click the three dots on the upper right corner and select **Use Devin’s Machine**.

</Frame>

Once selected, you’ll launch a new VSCode session. Click on “**Yes, I trust the authors**” and then you can view Devin’s code:

## Terminal

You can also use VSCode to open up a terminal! To do this simply use the shortcut `Ctrl-``  or, on a Mac, use the shortcut `Cmd-j`. This will open up a terminal where you can now run any commands you like or test Devin’s code.

## Tips

### View file diffs

You can view current and a log of Devin’s edits under three dots menu > **View Global File Diff.** This section will show all files modified by Devin, with the temporary exception of some edits made via the shell.

### Keep Devin in the loop

If you do edit files or otherwise make changes to Devin’s machine state, make sure to tell Devin what you changed! Otherwise Devin might get confused — imagine if your code mysteriously changed while you were in the middle of working on it. 

### Edit while it’s running

You can only use and interact with Devin’s machine while the sessions is running. Once the session is terminated it’s no longer available.

### Avoid sharing

Do ***not*** share the link with others since this will leak your files that you’ve given to Devin.
