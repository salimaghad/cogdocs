Similar to the migration and refactoring use cases, Devin is a helpful partner when trying to upgrade packages or legacy systems to modern frameworks or languages

### Use it for…
1. Updating deprecated libraries and frameworks to their latest versions
2. Upgrading to newer versions of programming languages
3. Improving code quality and writing tests

  <Accordion title="Java 7 to Java 8 Upgrade Playbook">

    ## Overview
    This playbook provides step-by-step instructions for upgrading a Java 7 project to Java 8.
    
    ## What’s Needed From User
    - Prompt the user to share the existing Java 7 project if it is not shared.
    
    ## Specification
    - For a public repository:
      - Share the final code changes as a zipped folder with the user.
      - Include a README file in the zipped folder with instructions on how to set up and run the upgraded project.
    - For a private repository:
      - Create a new branch named "java8-upgrade" or a similar relevant name.
      - Push the upgraded code to the new branch.
      - Inform the user about the availability of the upgraded code on the new branch.
    
    ## Procedure
    1. Verify if the provided project is indeed on Java 7. If it's already upgraded to Java 8 or a higher version, you can communicate this to the user and exit.
    2. Install Java 8 Development Kit (JDK).
    3. Update the project's build configuration to use Java 8
       - For Maven, update the `maven-compiler-plugin` configuration in `pom.xml`
       - For Gradle, update the `sourceCompatibility` and `targetCompatibility` in `build.gradle`
    4. Identify and replace deprecated Java 7 APIs with their Java 8 equivalents
    5. Analyze the codebase for potential Java 8 language and API enhancements
       - Consider using lambda expressions, method references, and streams where applicable
       - Evaluate the use of new Java 8 APIs such as `java.time` for date and time handling
       - Apply lambda expressions to simplify anonymous inner classes
       - Use method references to improve code readability
       - Leverage streams for more concise and expressive data processing
    6. Update unit tests to cover the refactored code and preserve existing functionality.
    7. Run the test suite and verify that all tests pass successfully.
    8. Perform thorough manual testing of the application to identify any runtime issues or behavioral changes.
    9. Update project documentation to reflect Java 8 usage and changes, including README and code comments. Also, mention how to set up and run the application.
    10. Build the project using the updated Java 8 configuration and verify that the application is up and running

## Advice and Tips
- Refer to the Java 8 documentation for detailed information on new features and APIs
