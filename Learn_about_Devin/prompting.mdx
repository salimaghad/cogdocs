Devin needs guidance to make sure it knows what tasks to execute, and more importantly, any preference in how it should execute those tasks. If not specified, Devin will make its own judgment calls. 

#### Prompt Library

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Clone and set up repo">
    ```  
    Clone the repository from https://github.com/onblog/SnowJena, specifically the snowjena-ticket-server application, and set it up locally. First, ensure the snowjena-ticket-server application builds and runs successfully with the current setup. You don’t need to worry about other applications in the repository. Next, upgrade the Spring Boot version to 3.3.2 in the snowjena-ticket-server application, making only the necessary changes related to this version upgrade. After the upgrade, test the snowjena-ticket-server application to confirm it still builds and runs correctly. You don't need to push code into a repository. Instead, share a zipped folder. Do share screenshot of application running successfully post upgrade in the browser as well.

  <Accordion title="Build a personal website">
    ```
    Create a one-page personal website for an online for {person} with the following features and sections:
    
    1. A fixed navigation bar with links to the sections (About Me, My Work, Publications, Education)
    2. A hero section with an picture of the person
    3. An "About Me" section with an brief description of the person
    4. A "My Work" section with a timeline of work experiences and projects 
    5. An interactive "Publications" section with links to published articles or papers available online authored by {person} 
    6. An "Education" section with the schools {person} attended, degrees and graduating year
    
    Include filler placeholder content where you can't find publicly available information. Make the website pretty.
    ```

  <Accordion title="Scrape emojis">
    ```
    Use this (https://github.com/muan/unicode-emoji-json) to write a function that converts a string like https://www.gstatic.com/android/keyboard/emojikitchen/20201001/u1f600/u1f600_u2615.png to "grinning_face_warm_beverage" by extracting the 2 emojis (u1f600, u2615) and converting them to actual emojis (use python for this) and then looking them up in the dictionary provided by the unicode emoji json library I linked. Throw an error if the emoji isn't found, including the codepoint in the error message. Then run the function on https://gist.githubusercontent.com/ryanseddon/0925ba915d4f865228ee3e6e0ddbe52c/raw/aa5cc2dbab3a9f3eaa1dc5d22dc1dc88d184dc4f/urls.txt and output a csv of the results.

  <Accordion title="Visualize inflation adjusted prices">
    ```
    Hi Devin, please go to https://beta.data.gov.sg/ and visualize how the distribution of flat prices has been changing over time. Then report back with any interesting insights.

  <Accordion title="Create architecture diagram for repository">
    ```
    **Playbook**: Create an architectural diagram of source code or a public GitHub repository
    
    ## Overview
    
    This playbook guides you through the process of creating an architectural diagram of a public GitHub repository or any source code using [C4-PlantUML](https://github.com/plantuml-stdlib/C4-PlantUML)
    
    ## What’s Needed From User
    
    1. Provide link to your desired public github repository or a zip file containing your source code
    2. Provide instructions if you want the architecture diagram to be customized
    
    ## Procedure
    
    1. Install dependencies
    
    - Ensure that Java runtime is installed in your system
    - Install Graphviz using `sudo apt install graphviz`
    
    2. Download PlantUML from the browser
    
        - Navigate to [https://plantuml.com/download](https://plantuml.com/download) in your browser and download [PlantUML](https://github.com/plantuml/plantuml/releases/download/v1.2024.5/plantuml-1.2024.5.jar)
        - Ensure that it is included in your PATH
    
    3. Extract the source code (if zip file is provided)
    
    - Download the zip file provided by the user directly to the current working directory
    - Extract the source code from the zip file using `unzip <file_name.zip>` 
    
    4. Setup the GitHub repository (if provided)
    
        - Clone the GitHub repository provided by the user
        - Navigate to the correct directory
    
    5. Analyze the functionality of different components in the app carefully
    
        - Analyze the app directory
        - Understand the functionality of each component in the app very carefully
    
    6. Generate the `.puml` file
        - Keep `Person` element outside `System_Boundary`
        - Make sure to add all the essential components and their relevant details in the diagram
        - Refer to [https://github.com/plantuml-stdlib/C4-PlantUML/blob/master/README.md](https://github.com/plantuml-stdlib/C4-PlantUML/blob/master/README.md) for detailed instructions
        - Include the following in the `.puml` file after `@startuml`
    
    ```javascript
           !include  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plantuml-stdlib/C4-PlantUML/master/C4_Container.puml
           !include https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plantuml-stdlib/C4-PlantUML/master/C4_Component.puml
    ```
    7. Generate the architecture diagram
    
        - Generate the architecture diagram from the `.puml` file
        - Make sure that the command is run without errors
    
    8. Share the final deliverables
    
        - Share the architecture diagram with the user as an attachment
    
    ## Deliverables
    1. The architecture diagram of the GitHub repository or the source code
    
    ## Advice and Pointers
    1. Ensure that the diagram is clear and easy to understand```

#### Be clear and specific

Provide clear, detailed instructions or requirements for Devin to follow when executing a given task. Nothing is “too obvious” for Devin, but it will do its best to clarify and ask questions along the way. Some potential tactics:

1. Keep sentences short
2. Specific the steps to complete a task
3. Use imperative verbs
4. Use bullets and/or sub-bullets
5. Name specific repos, libraries, or branches you want Devin to work with, or equally as important, not work with!

#### Split complex tasks into simpler sub-tasks, even sessions

As with any entry-level engineer, Devin is more likely to struggle with complex, longer tasks. Break down a complex project or tasks into sub-tasks as much as possible. In fact, we recommend breaking down tasks into separate sessions entirely.

#### Use Playbooks

For multistep tasks where you see your prompt getting lengthy, we suggest using [Playbooks](/Working_with_Teams/playbooks-intro).  Playbooks are like custom system prompts — they allow Devin to perform better and more reliably on longer tasks.

#### Provide references or examples

When available, link documentation, websites or example outputs that are helpful and relevant for the task.  If you don’t provide any resources, Devin will search for documentation to support it in the task independently, and may make discretionary decisions on which documentation to use or path to take if there are multiple options.

#### Ask for an ETA

Check with Devin how long it will take it to complete a given tasks. It may not always be accurate, but it will help you understand if the task is too large, or when to come back and check in on the progress Devin is making.

#### Jump in!

Give Devin instructions while it's working, add more steps to Devin's plan. The browser and editor also allow you to interact with Devin’s machine and “take over” from Devin when necessary.
